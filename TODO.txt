 
[] Make constants Variables class
    ---For board color, food color, reversal food color, snake color, snake head color


[] design food spawn logic
    [] food should spawn randomly throughout the board, on spaces not occupued by the snake

        []possibly make option for food to spawn on outer edge


[] snake spawn logic
    --snake should spawn randomly
        --should be oriented in random manner, but not start crossing the border

[]design reversal logid
    --reverse doubly linked list

    --make the new head a different color


[] make a grid in tkinter

design snake spawn logic
    [] snake should spawn randomly
        -- should start out with a set amout of length, determined by a variable in constansts class






[] make singly linked list t0 represent snake

    [] keep reference to both head and tail of snake

 ---Make Universal Variables
    ---For board color, food color, reversal food color, snake color, snake head color


---Design food spawn logic
    ---Food should spawn randomly throughout the board
        ---They shouldn't spawn on the outer edge, unless <10% of the board is open
        ---shouldn't spawn on the snake, either


---Need to make grid in Tkinter



---Design snake spawn logic
    --- snake should spawn randomly
        --- should start out with three squares of length

    ---should be oriented in random manner, but not start crossing the border


--- Design reversal logic
    --- Reverse doubly linked list

    ---make the new head a different color



---design snake move logic
